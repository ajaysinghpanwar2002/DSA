// 2D Dynamic Programming

// At its core, 2D Dynamic Programming involves solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems arranged in a 2D grid or matrix. Each cell within the matrix represents a subproblem, and the solutions to these subproblems contribute to constructing the optimal solution. This approach is particularly useful when the problem has two independent variables that need to be optimized.
