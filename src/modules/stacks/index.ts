/**
 * @stack
 * A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is named after the real-life concept of a stack, such as a stack of plates or a stack of books. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.
