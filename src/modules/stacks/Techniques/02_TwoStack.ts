/**
 * Identifying the Two-Stack Problem Pattern
 * 
 * Reverse Order: When you need to reverse the order of elements or perform operations in the reverse order from the input, the Two-Stack technique can be helpful. The auxiliary stack can be used to store the elements in reverse order while processing the main stack.
 * 
 * Nested Structure: If the problem involves a nested structure or nested elements, such as nested parentheses, expressions, or hierarchical data, the Two-Stack technique can simplify the processing of such structures
 * 
 * Inversion or Reversal: When you need to perform inversion or reversal operations on the elements or substructures, the Two-Stack technique can be employed to achieve the desired result efficiently.
 * 
 * Temporary Storage: If the problem requires temporary storage of elements or intermediate results during the execution of an algorithm, the Two-Stack technique can provide a convenient way to store and retrieve the necessary data.
